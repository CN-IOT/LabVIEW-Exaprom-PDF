# labview-PDF-writer
This is a fork of the Exaprom PDF writer, version 2.0
Originally written by Jean-Marc Simard.  Latest known release was 10-december-2013.
Exaprom Inc., ceased operation on 16-jul-2018, according to opencorporates.com.
Last known communication with Jean Marc was in 2015.

This version updates the itextsharp dll to work in both 32 and 64 bit systems.  Also moved the install location to the
user.lib directory, instead of a combo of vi.lib and a sprinkling of other directories.  Not quite as convenient in the menu
system as the original menu system, but much easier to install.

The dll was recompiled in AnyCPU mode on Visual Studio Community Edition 2019.
